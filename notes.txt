// we are listening to 2 routes in port 7777
app.use("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello there !!");
}); this function is known as request handler/ route handler

app.use("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Main page");
}); // keep this at last else every route will go to /, so order is important here
